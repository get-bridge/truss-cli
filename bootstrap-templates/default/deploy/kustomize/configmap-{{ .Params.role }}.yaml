# Environment variables that are the same across all environments can be set
# directly in this file. For items that differ per environment, such as Vault
# paths that contain env and region or references to Terraform-managed infra,
# like RDS endpoints, we recommend overriding those in Terraform. See
# kustomize.tf for additional info.
